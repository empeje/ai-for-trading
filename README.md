# About

AI for Trading is a repository mainly for personal use and secondarily for others who are in the same path trying to learn and use AI/ML for trading.

# Motivation

## Entrepreneurship

Very recently I'm more and more interested in learning and applying more concept of ML to trading, also known as algorithmic trading, as it provides a unique opportunity for technical mind like myself who are interested in entrepreneurship. **Unlike** many other form of entrepreneurship, for example startups or consulting (like I did years ago with [Kulkul][KULKUL]), algorithmic trading

1. doesn't require you to do marketing;

2. doesn't require you to leave your job while building your business; there's always market that is open in 24/7 where you are especially crypto, so it is an opportunity to do it after work;

3. you can focus on what you like, which is a technical stuff;

4. you get an immediate feedback loop when developing your idea and also when deploying your idea.

## Materials

Another very niche reason is because I want to subscribe to AI for Trading from Udacity but I couldn't because somehow my country is not allowed to subscribe, and also I figured I can curate my own version and also see their [open source materials][AI_FOR_TRADING].

## Antifragility

I also want to open-source it because open-source is antifragile, it keeps live in the internet and the heart of people with the same interest once you put it open in the internet.
